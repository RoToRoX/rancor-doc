The Rancor microworld is a simplified nuclear reactor simulation platform designed to be a more accessible means of performing research on modern, digital reactor human-machine interface systems. By greatly reducing the number of critical parameters, the microworld can allow for quick iterations and changes to reactor HMIs and advancement of those designs.

## Use cases
The platform has been used to assess situational awareness, learnability, different control schemes, overviews, alarm systems, and more. The high level of configurability and malleability of the system allows for increases to potential experimental models and research questions. 

## Terms
Throughout this wiki and research documents published using the Rancor microworld you will see some frequently used terms that we want to define here. 
- Scenario: This one is a very frequently used term. A scenario is the set of rules, parameters, faults, variables, or manipulations that your experiment may use. These 'settings' for lack of a better term are dynamic and can be tweaked to suit your research needs. 
- Procedure: As this is a child of nuclear power and the simulators in that industry there are a set of procedures that you will use to guide your participants to their goal. While you can use the microworld without a procedure, it may prove extremely difficult to manage the parameters and systems on the fly. When we use the term procedure we truly do mean a step by step guide on manipulating the reactor to the desired end goal of the scenario.
- P&ID: A P&ID is also known as a piping and instrumentation diagram and serves as a model of the system. When launched in the standard mode it is the window on the top right of your screen.
- Radar plot: This is the spoke-and-wheel looking overview object on the left of the default launched program. This is a configurable visualization that serves to show several different variables of interest in an effort to create a visually salient shape that can be associated with a given plant state.
- Trip: When we talk about a reactor trip or you see the 'Trip reactor' button this is very similar to tripping a breaker in your home. When you trip a nuclear reactor you are throwing a switch which actuated the control rods to halt the nuclear fission reaction in the core. Trips are safety-driven actions and can have large operational and financial impacts in the nuclear power industry.
- INI file: Pronounced eye-en-eye file. These are files in the configuration folder within the Executables folder. Currently these are the way we adjust settings in the Rancor simulator, such as screen size, radar plot characteristics, colors, etc. Colors are required to be in hexadecimal or color name formats.
- Auto/Manual: These terms are fairly obvious, however it doesn't hurt to explain what these mean in the context of a Rancor experiment. Auto will perform control actions in response to the simulation and various critical parameters. This will only maintain a steady state unless you have enacted a set goal (60% power) then it will navigate to that according to its own logic. By the inverse manual requires input from the participant to affect change in the given system and the participant will be required to respond to the changes in states and system contexts.
