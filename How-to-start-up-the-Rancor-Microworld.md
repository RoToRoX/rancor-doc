This section of the guide assumes that you have the Rancor microworld downloaded, unzipped, and have found a home for it locally on your machine. Please refer to the [Getting Started](https://github.com/rogerlew/rancor-release/wiki/Getting-Started) page for instructions on sourcing and downloading the application. This area will guide you through the folder structure of Rancor and ensure you know where things are as you perform your research.

## First Level
The initial folders you will see when you open the Rancor application are: .vs, Application, and Rancor wiki icons. The only folder that is critical for operation is the Application folder. The others can be ignored.

## Second Level - Executables and Procedures
This is the primary delineation between the procedure documentation and the main application files. 

### Procedures
Navigating to procedures will allow you to find and open pdf files of procedures intended to be used with the scenarios. There are two options between English/Imperial measurements and Si Units (Metric) measurements, depending on your specific needs for the experiment you are running. There is also a folder named Korean. This folder includes procedures that have been translated into the Korean language.

### Executables
This folder is where you will likely spend the majority of your time while using the Rancor microworld. It includes several folders and a large list of other files which Rancor relies on during the simulation. Refer to the image below, highlighted items are the primary things you will be interacting with and are described below.

#### Configuration
This folder defined the look and feel of the Rancor simulation environment. There are different settings that can be changed in these files to enable different color schemes and screeen resolutions.
