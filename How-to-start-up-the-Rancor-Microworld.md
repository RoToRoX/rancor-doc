This section of the guide assumes that you have the Rancor microworld downloaded, unzipped, and have found a home for it locally on your machine. Please refer to the [Getting Started](https://github.com/rogerlew/rancor-release/wiki/Getting-Started) page for instructions on sourcing and downloading the application. This area will guide you through the folder structure of Rancor and ensure you know where things are as you perform your research.
