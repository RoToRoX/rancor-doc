Welcome to the Rancor wiki page. The Rancor Microworld is a simplified nuclear power plant simulator. It represents the process of an integrated pressurized light water reactor core with a secondary Rankine cycle turbine/generator. The reactor core is governed by simplified core physics. Operators have the ability to raise and lower control rods to change the reactivity and consequently generate more or less electricity. The microworld provides a digital human machine interface for operating and monitoring the plant efficiently to maximize profits within the simulation.

The goal of Rancor is to support research operations in advanced and novel process control industries HMI design and human factors.
