# Rancor Web-API


## Overview

Rancor has a web api for communicating between server and client instances. 
When launched as "Server" Rancor runs the simulation model and the HMI windows (unless ran as HEADLESS). 
When ran as Client only the HMI windows are ran and the Client communicates with a Server over the Web-API.
